## Objective:

**To build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase your professional portfolio, which will include the projects you’ll build throughout your Full-Stack Web Development Program, to your professional network and potential employers.**

## Context:

For a professional web developer, it’s essential to have a designated place to present his work and demonstrate relevant skills such as problem-solving or practical knowledge in programming languages. Since chances are high on the quality of the website itself, it’s essential for it to be of high code quality.<br/>

In addition, as responsive design has become a basic requirement for nearly all web-based projects, it’s important that this website is responsive and run smoothly on all devices.<br/>

The goal of this project is to create a working website, complete with subpages, that features key information about yourself as a web developer, relevant work examples, as well as contact details.<br/>

This website also shall privide the option to include the projects are be build up throughout this Full-Stack Web Development Program. That keept in mind while planning the HTML structure of this website.<br/>
